# Classical Cryptography Algorithms in C

This project contains implementations of various classical encryption algorithms in C. It is intended for educational purposes to understand how these algorithms work at a basic level.

## 🔐 Algorithms Implemented

- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Atbash Cipher**
- **August Cipher**
- **Affine Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Gronsfeld Cipher**
- **Beaufort Cipher**
- **Autoclave / Running Key Cipher**
- **N-gram Operations**
- **Hill Cipher**
- **Rail Fence Cipher**
- **Route Cipher**
- **Myszkowski Cipher**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C Programming**
- Compiler: GCC / any C compiler

## 📁 Folder Structure

All files are implemented individually and can be compiled and run separately. Each file corresponds to the name of the algorithm.

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

Use the terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
gcc algorithm_name.c -o output
./output

gcc Caesar.c -o caesar
./caesar

📚 Note
These are classical ciphers and are not secure by modern standards. Use them only for learning and experimentation.
